# comp-neuro

This repository contains a collection of personal projects exploring key concepts and models in **computational neuroscience**.

## Contents

Example projects include:
- **Rate and spiking neuron models** (e.g., integrate-and-fire, Hodgkin-Huxley)
- **Model neural systems** (e.g. Perceptron)
- **Synaptic plasticity** (e.g. Hebbian learning, STDP)

Each project is self-contained and typically presented in a Jupyter.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Status
Ongoing â€” new models and notebooks will be added as I explore more topics.
